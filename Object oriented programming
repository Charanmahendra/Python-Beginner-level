Object oriented programming(OOP) allows the programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

A method is a function that “belongs to” an object. (In Python, the term method is not unique to class instances: other object types can have methods as well. For example, list objects have methods called append, insert, remove, sort, and so on.

These methods acts as functions that use  the information about the object,as well as the object itself and return results,or change the current object.
